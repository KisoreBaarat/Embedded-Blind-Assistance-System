"# Embedded-Blind-Assistance-System" 
This project aims to assist visually impaired individuals in their day to day activities without the need of an external caretaker.
Navigating environments filled with obstacles and potential hazards can be challenging for the visually impaired, leading to a higher risk of accidents and reduced mobility.
This project tackles these issues by implementing real time obstacle detection GPS tracking and emergency alerts.
The key considerations for this project include Mobility enhancement, Priority to safety, Leveraging nuanced technology such as RTOS and an Efficient Response System.
